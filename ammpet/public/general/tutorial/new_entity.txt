** This tutorial aims to explain how to create a new entity using others as reference **

1) Database:
    1.1) Create new table with corresponting columns (use one of txt examples in /general/database/tables/)
    1.2) Note all tables must have: ID (AUTOINCREMENT), CREATED (with default), CREATE_BY, UPDATE (with default and update), UPDATED_BY

2) Model:
    2.1) Copy Model "Params" and paste it under /classes/models/
    2.2) Change variable: "protected $table = XXXXXX" with the table name created on 1.1
    2.2) Review field definitions according to columns on table
    2.3) Review "function __construct" inputs according to fields defined on 2.2
    2.4) Review "$this ->" settings in "function __construct" according to fields defined on 2.2
    2.5) Note that when there is reference to other objects, there is a special treatment (check example of Client in Model Animal)

3) Controller:
    3.1) Copy Controler "Params" and paste it under /classes/controlers/
    3.2) Change all "Params" occurrences by the name of the new object. Examples:
            private $object = 'params';
            private $UCF_object = 'Params';
    3.3) Remove functions: getParamValue and getParamListByType (they are specific form "Params")
    3.4) Review load functions to map new entity fields accordingly

4) Views:
    4.1) Copy views: copy folder "params" and paste it in /classes/models/
    4.2) Review each view:
        4.2.1) Replace "Params" by the new entity name
        4.2.2) Adjust view titles
        4.2.3) Adjust other info as needed
